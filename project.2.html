      <p> One time I had an "Intro to Chemistry" class. In that class, we had to preform labs whose grades were heavily reliant on the quality of data and understanding of math that you had in the class. One day, I forgot to take a measurement for one of my labs as we were moving quickly so I was unable to do some of the calculations. The worst part was that the part that I forgot was very vital to the calculations so I couldn't even start on them. </p>

<p> I had collected all the other data so knowing what I knew about math, I created a two-part calculator to help me solve for "x."</p>
    
<p> The whole point of the lab was to determine the
   percentage of diluted dye was left in an unknown, previously prepared test tube based off of how much light it was absorbing
    (not the ones above, the dyes we were working with were very diluted and 
   the color of it was very faint). What I forgot to get 
   was how much dye I started with. However, I had measured 
   the wavelength of light each test tube of diluted dye was 
   absorbing so I put that on a Excel spreadsheet, the pairs of
    each wavelength to be the amount of dye they had. 
  </p>

  <p> I was previously told that each test tube
    should have about .07 grams of dye in them so I tested out the outcome of my data
     as if I had measured .07 grams of dye in my beginning test tube. We had used a total 
     of about seven test tubes for the lab, diluting about 10mL's 
      of the previous diluted test tube into the next each time.
     Since we "started" with 0.07 grams of dye in the first test tube, we can do the math to 
      figure out the percentages for the rest. 
  </p>

  <p> I could have just used 0.07 grams as my missing data point, but my problem was
    that I was being graded on accuracy and precision. Therefore, I double checked the accuracy and precision of my work with 
     this:

    <p> What this did for me was that for each small value of dye that I put
       in, it gave me the percentage of dye that was left in that specific test tube so that I could 
       plug each one to their corresponding data points that I put into Excel earlier.
 
     </p>

     <p> The outputs usually look like this, including a quick reminder to round the number to three significant figures for the most accurate numbers (C++ does odd rounding sometimes, and I'd rather avoid that for now).

      <p>After getting the "unknown" percentages of dye in each test tube, I 
        created another calculator that would tell me how accurate the 
        amount of dye I guessed was depending on some data that I inputted: an inverted 
        equation from the plotted points mentioned previously and the wavelength 
        of light absorbed by the "unknown" test tube (which would be plugged into that inverted equation, as variable "x").

  <p>So I guessed and inserted equations into my code and on about after my fifth try, I ended up with an answer that gave me 0.33% error.</p>
  <p>The first output is supposed to tell me the percentage of dye
    that is left in the "unknown" test tube. The second says the percent 
    error that inputting that value gives.
 </p>
  <div> <img src="images/Screenshot 2023-09-28 155225.png" class="articlesizing"> </div>

<p>I had done it. I was so relieved.</p>
<p>Despite this discovery, I was able to redo that portion of
   the lab correctly. There, I was able to measure out 0.075 grams of 
   dye, with 0.0128% dye in my unknown and with a 2.46 percent error.
</p>
<p> Of course, I had to double check the accuracy of my calculator versus my data.</p>
<p>So I did, and it turns out that my calculator isn't that off in this case. The calculator ended up
   saying that I had the least percent error when my grams of dye was at 0.073.
    The real value was supposed to be 0.075, but that's super close.
</p>
<p>After inputting the values and doing the math, if I had stuck with the answer that 
  my program gave me, I would have had an overall percent error of 1.81 percent. That's not bad!
   It get's me by and get's the job done. Overall, 10/10 experience.
